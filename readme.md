# How to use

## First

This is all of the source codes of team Ninja from Japan.

If there is any error or English syntax error, please contact me.

If you want my source code quickly, please look at `code(c++)/Hikaru.cpp`.


## OverView

There are 8 folders.

> cospace2019-ninja-share

> ​	├	array2coordinate
>
> ​	├	auto dll generator(c++)
>
> ​	├	code(c)

>
> ​	├	dll generator(c)

Each folder has software or program.

For details, please read each folder's ReadMe.

### Array2Coordinate

This software is written by c++.  This software's purpose is to repesent wall positions as formula.

If you put the array of the map to the software, the software returns the formulas of all wall position.

This makes it possible to calculate own robot coordinate in world 1.

## auto dll generator(c++)

If you are nerbous to run compiler every time you save the code, just use this foftware to auto compile.

This software will compile your source code automatically. This software compiles your code when it detects the changes of your source codes.

## code(c)

This folder has cospace source code written in C-language. However, I last time I used C-language for rescue simulation was a ancient period. So, you should not use this source code. It has bugs, and old way.

## code(c++)

This folder has cospace source code written in C++-language. This is the latest version. I became the champion of WorldCup 2019.

keywords: Dijkstra, Astar, Odometory

##  dll generator(c)

This is the compiler for C-language. This compiler search all `.c` files in `code(c)` and compile it. So, you don't need to type a complicated command to run compiler. Just run it in command prompt or duble click it.


## dll generator(C++)

This is the compiler for C++-language. This compiler search all `.cpp` files in `code(c++)` and compile it. The other sentences are same as `dll generator(c)`.

## image2array

This software convert image of cospace to arrays. This way is not useful from 2019 rules because we can't know the map infomation before.

But in world1, you can use this.

## music

This folder has some sound effects for auto dll generator. You can custamize by editing souce code of auto dll generator or just replace the files.



## Required to use my source code

Please be open to the other teams. I want to increase all team's level.
